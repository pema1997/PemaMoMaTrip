        <p> The Starry Night is one of the famous works by the Dutch painter Vincen Van Gogh. It is believed that he painted this while being held in the mental asylum at Saint-Remy where was recovering from mental illness and his ear amputation.The dark spires in the foreground are cypress trees, plants most often associated with cemeteries and death. This connection gives a special significance to this van Gogh quote, "Looking at the stars always makes me dream. Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star."
