        <p> It was raining this morning and I got off my work a little earlier today.<br> So, for the rest of my day I decided to take a trip to MoMa despite the rainfall. And it was worth it!I've been to MoMa two times before this trip <br>but everytime I visit this Museum, I feel different and a little confused about life and my perspectives on Art. Personally, I don't have a hunch<br> of art, let alone the modern Arts but I hope to explore more about art after each Museum trips like MoMa.  </p>
